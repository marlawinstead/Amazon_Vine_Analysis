# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to analyze the Amazon Vine Program and determine bias of its reviews. The Amazon Vine Program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies pay a fee to Amazon and provide products to the program’s members, who are then required to publish a review. For this project, we focused on reviews for beauty products. We will analyze the dataset and see if there is bias from members to provide positive reviews for products.

## Results
